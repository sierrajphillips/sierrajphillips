I am a PhD candidate in the Hydrologic Sciences Graduate Group at UC Davis and a member of the [Pasternack Lab](http://pasternack.ucdavis.edu/) . My academic background is in ecology and my professional background is in civil engineering. My dissertation work is focused on the development, testing, and application of a riparian seedling recruitment algorithm that can be used to aid river management and restoration (or scientific questions!). Most of my code is focused on post-processing hydrodynamic model data and geospatial workflow automation. \
Currently working on: [River Architect](https://github.com/RiverArchitect/program)
