I am a Hydrologic Sciences doctoral student in the [Pasternack Lab](http://pasternack.ucdavis.edu/) at UC Davis with a background in ecology and civil engineering. \
Most of my code is focused on post-processing hydrodynamic model data and geospatial workflow automation. \
Currently working on: [River Architect](https://github.com/RiverArchitect/program)
